# heroku-buildpack-imagemagick-heif

The rise in popularity and use of HEIF/HEIC(High Efficency Image Format) means your project's image processing also needs to be able to handle this format.
The current default version of imagemagick installed on heroku:22 dynos is a version 6.xx and does not support processing heic image files.

This [Heroku buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) vendors a version of ImageMagick with **WEBP and HEIF support** binaries into your project.

This one works was built for [**Heroku stack 20**](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/stack).

The tar file in the [/build folder](./build) currently contains:

Version: ImageMagick 7.1.0-55

You will need to build a new binary if you want to use a newer or different version. To build a new binary see [How to Build a New Binary](#how-to-build-a-new-binary)

# Usage

## Step 1 : Adding the buildpack

From your projects "Settings" tab add this buildpack to your app in the 1st position:

```bash
https://github.com/yespark/heroku-imagemagick-buildpack
```

**NOTE:** \__To ensure the newer version of imagemagick is found in the $PATH and installed first make sure this buildpack is added to the top of the buildpack list or at "index 1"._

## Step 2 : Clear the cache(**Not Sure if this is necessary**)

Since the installation is cached you might want to clean it out due to config changes.

```bash
heroku plugins:install heroku-builds
heroku builds:cache:purge -a HEROKU_APP_NAME
```

# How to Build a New Binary (if you want to make somes changes)

The binary in this repo was built in a heroku:22 docker image running in a local dev environment.
However, there is a script called [**build.sh**](./build.sh) made to build a tar file through docker easily, it will be copied to the `build` directory. Then you should commit this changes to your git, and adjust the buildpack url previously mentionned just above.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed and running in local dev environment. [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
